CAD Design & Engineering Expertise (SolidWorks & PTC Creo)
As a skilled CAD designer, I have leveraged both SolidWorks and PTC Creo to deliver precision-driven 3D modeling, assembly design, and engineering solutions across diverse industries. My work encompasses end-to-end product development, from conceptual design to detailed manufacturing-ready deliverables.

Key Contributions & Skills:

Parametric Modeling & Design:

Utilized SolidWorks for intuitive parametric modeling, creating complex parts and assemblies with design intent embedded for easy iteration.

Employed PTC Creo for advanced parametric and surfacing workflows, tackling high-complexity geometries and large-scale assemblies in industries like automotive and aerospace.

Simulation & Analysis:

Performed structural, thermal, and motion studies in SolidWorks Simulation to validate designs, optimize material usage, and ensure compliance with performance criteria.

Leveraged Creo Simulate for finite element analysis (FEA) to test load conditions and refine designs for manufacturability and durability.

Sheet Metal, Surfacing, & Drafting:

Developed sheet metal components in SolidWorks with automated flat patterns and bend calculations, streamlining fabrication processes.

Created intricate freeform surfaces in PTC Creo for ergonomic consumer products and aerodynamic components, ensuring seamless transitions between complex curves.

Collaboration & Data Management:

Used SolidWorks PDM and Creo Windchill for version control, revision tracking, and secure collaboration across multidisciplinary teams.

Generated detailed 2D drawings with GD&T in both platforms, adhering to ASME/ISO standards for clarity in manufacturing and QA.

Interoperability & Adaptability:

Translated models between SolidWorks and Creo using neutral formats (STEP, IGES), maintaining design integrity in cross-platform workflows.

Customized toolsets (e.g., Creoâ€™s Flexible Modeling Extension, SolidWorks Macros) to automate repetitive tasks and enhance design efficiency.

Industries & Applications:

Automotive components, industrial machinery, consumer electronics, and aerospace systems.

Prototyping, injection molding, CNC machining, and additive manufacturing support.

By combining the user-friendly interface of SolidWorks with the robust capabilities of PTC Creo, I have consistently delivered innovative, cost-effective solutions that bridge creativity with engineering rigor. My work emphasizes design optimization, cross-functional collaboration, and adherence to project timelines, ensuring seamless transitions from digital models to physical products.
